//Very common task in Web Apps is the retrieving individual data items from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entire new page. This led to the concept of Ajax that allow web pages to request small chunks of data (such as HTML, XML, JSON, or plain text) and display them only when needed.
//XmlHttpRequest and Fetch API allow to make HTTP requests from the web sites to retrieve the data in an Asynchronous manner. 
//Ajax: Asynchronous JS and XML was using XMLHttpRequest to request XML data. In recent times, its JSON data instead of XML.  Ajax is common among all kinds of Web and Mobile Apps. In mobile Apps, to speed the things up even further, mobile apps store assets and data on the user's device when they are first requested, meaning that on subsequent visits they use the local versions instead of downloading fresh copies when the page is first loaded. The content is only reloaded from the server when it has been updated. XMLHttpRequest (which is frequently abbreviated to XHR) is a fairly old technology now â€” it was invented by Microsoft in the late '90s, and has been standardized across browsers for quite a long time.
